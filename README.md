A multi-package workspace that provides:
- Parser + semantic intelligence library (`packages/code-intelligence`)
- Headless gateway/CLI/MCP server (`apps/server`)
- React UI for exploring indexed projects (`apps/client`)
- Theme system and markdown extensions (under `packages/`)

## Getting Started

- Prerequisites: Node 18+, npm 9+, Python 3.8+ (optional for embeddings)
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev (full stack): `npm run dev`
  - Starts UI + backend with hot reload and ensures the Python sidecar is ready on first run.

Useful workspace scripts:
- `npm run build:packages` ‚Äì build core packages
- `npm run build:backend` ‚Äì build server only
- `npm run dev:backend` ‚Äì run server + oraicle library in watch mode
- `npm run dev:frontend` ‚Äì run UI + packages in watch mode

## Packages

- `packages/code-intelligence` ‚Äì core parsing, embeddings, and knowledge-graph utilities
- `packages/extended-markdown` ‚Äì remark/unified extensions and React helpers
- `packages/theme-system` ‚Äì composable theme primitives for the UI

## Apps

- `apps/server` ‚Äì MCP/HTTP/CLI server for indexing, search, tasks, notes, and rules
- `apps/client` ‚Äì React UI that talks to the server via MCP/HTTP

## Development Notes

- Run `node scripts/setup.js` to verify native parsers, grammars, and optional sidecars
- Configure log verbosity via `LOG_LEVEL=debug|info|warn|error|silent`
- Generated artifacts (coverage, logs, local DBs) are ignored by Git

## Release Checklist (suggested)

- Clean working tree: remove coverage, logs, and local DBs
- Run tests in all workspaces: `npm test --workspaces`
- Lint + typecheck: `npm run lint --workspaces` and `npm run type-check --workspace @felix/client`
- Verify `files` and `exports` fields in each `package.json`
- Confirm license and README per package
- Tag and publish packages as needed (server/UI may remain private apps)
