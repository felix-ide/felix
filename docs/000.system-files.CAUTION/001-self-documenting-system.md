# üìö Self-Documenting System

## üîç Overview

This system helps AIgent Smith maintain context between sessions by providing a structured approach to documentation, code navigation, and context preservation. It ensures that both humans and AI assistants can efficiently understand and work with the codebase through integrated architecture indexing, code indexing, and documentation standards.

## üìÅ Documentation Organization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FOLDER STRUCTURE AND NAMING CONVENTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

The AIgent Smith documentation follows a strictly defined structure that must be maintained:

#### System Documentation Files (NEVER MOVE)

The System Documentation files are **CRITICAL** and must NEVER be moved from their root location:

- **Root `docs/` Directory System Files**:
  - `000-framework-overview.md` - Framework fundamentals
  - `001-self-documenting-system.md` - This documentation system description
  - `002-automated-test-writing-and-running.md` - Testing documentation
  - `003-project-plan-to-code-process.md` - Code process documentation
  
  > üö´ **CRITICAL WARNING**: These system files must NEVER be moved, renamed, or relocated into subdirectories. They are the foundation of the system and must remain at the docs/ root level.

#### Chronological Structure

All documentation follows a chronological organization pattern using numerical prefixes:

- **Root `docs/` Files**: Numbered sequentially (`00-`, `01-`, etc.) to show order of introduction
- **Project Phases**: Properly prefixed files in the project-phases directory
- **Three-Folder Structure**: `original/`, `unfinished/`, and `finished/` track document status

#### Project Phase Documentation Structure

The `docs/project-phases/` directory contains three subdirectories that track document status:

1. **`original/`**: Contains original documentation that should NEVER be modified
   - Preserves the baseline documentation that establishes core concepts
   - Maintains historical record of initial design decisions
   - Files can be copied to unfinished/ for updates, but originals must be preserved

2. **`unfinished/`**: Contains documentation for ongoing work and active development
   - Houses specifications for features being actively implemented
   - Updated regularly with new developments and changes
   - Serves as the current working documentation for in-progress features

3. **`finished/`**: Contains completed documentation for implemented features
   - Houses final documentation for completed features
   - Includes comprehensive details on implemented components
   - Serves as reference material for future development

#### Proper Project Phase Naming

Project phase documents follow strict naming conventions:

1. **True Phase Documents** (01-05): Represent core project phases
   - `01-phase-1-core-infrastructure.md`
   - `02-phase-2-basic-functionality.md`
   - `03-phase-3-advanced-features.md`
   - `04-phase-4-refinement.md`
   - `05-phase-5-integration-deployment.md`

2. **Side-track Documents** (06+): Represent unplanned deviations from original phases
   - Start with numerical prefix (e.g., `06-sqlite-storage-system.md`)
   - Document work that was NOT part of the original project plan
   - MUST NOT use "phase-" in the name as they are not planned phases
   - Numbered chronologically by when the side-track was started
   
3. **Important Distinction - Side-tracks vs. Features**:
   - Side-tracks are NOT simply "feature implementations" within planned phases
   - They represent work that diverted from the original complete project plan
   - Before any code was written, we had a complete cohesive plan for phases 1-5
   - Any work not originally planned is a side-track, not a planned feature
   - Proper naming helps distinguish between planned work (phases) and unplanned diversions
   - When many side-tracks accumulate, we should reorganize and create a new cohesive plan

### Documentation Categories

The documentation system is organized into several key sections:

1. **Architecture Documentation** [‚úÖ Complete]
   - `docs/00-system-architecture.md` - Main architecture index
   - `docs/06-unified-architecture-plan.md` - Detailed architectural design

| **Cross-Document References** | `‚Üí See file:line` | `‚Üí See docs/00-system-architecture.md:100-120` | Related documentation |

### Felix References [‚úÖ Complete]

The code indexer uses these reference formats for code navigation:

| Reference Type | Format | Example | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|---------|---------|
| **File References** | `F#:path` | `F1:/path/to/file.js` | Track source files |
| **System References** | `S#:NAME\|Description\|` | `S1:SYSTEM_NAME\|Description\|` | Major systems |

| **Documentation Sections** | `DS#:NAME\|Description\|` | `DS1:SECTION_NAME\|Description\|` | Documentation sections |

## üîÑ Document Update Process

### When to Update Documentation

Documentation should be updated in the following scenarios:
1. When implementing new features
2. When fixing bugs that change behavior
3. When refactoring code that affects architecture
4. When changing APIs or interfaces
5. When completing a phase or milestone
6. When side-tracks accumulate and require reorganization

### Three-Folder Document Workflow

The process of updating documents follows a specific workflow through the three-folder structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Original Documents (original/)"] -->|"Copy to edit"| B["Working Documents (unfinished/)"]
    B -->|"Implementation Complete"| C["Completed Documents (finished/)"]
    C -->|"Future Changes Needed"| B
    D["New Side-track Identified"] -->|"Create new document"| B
    E["Phase Reorganization"] -->|"Create new cohesive plan"| B
```

#### Document Progression Steps:

1. **Starting Point - Original Documents**:
   - Files in `original/` are NEVER modified directly
   - They preserve the initial project plan and documentation
   - Original documents serve as the complete reference implementation plan

2. **Document Splitting Process**:
   - Examine implementation status using current-work.md and current-work-logs
   - Create complementary split versions of the document:
     - `finished/` - contains only completed portions
     - `unfinished/` - contains only in-progress/planned portions
   - Both maintain the exact same structure as the original
   - When merged, these files should recreate the original document exactly

3. **Finished Document Guidelines**:
   - Extract ONLY the completed portions from the original document
   - Maintain EXACT wording and structure as the original
   - Include section headings for organization, even for incomplete sections
   - Mark incomplete sections with "‚è≥ Not Yet Implemented" or similar
   - Do NOT include implementation plans for unfinished work

4. **Unfinished Document Guidelines**:
   - Extract ONLY the in-progress or planned portions from the original document
   - Maintain EXACT wording and structure as the original
   - Include section headings for organization, even for completed sections
   - Mark completed sections with "‚úÖ Complete" and reference to finished document
   - Keep all planning details for unfinished work

5. **Verification Process**:
   - Verify that combining the unfinished + finished = original document
   - Use diff tools to check for complete coverage
   - Ensure no content from original document is missing from either version
   - Make adjustments if needed to maintain perfect complementary structure

6. **Handling Side-tracks**:
   - Side-tracks follow the same splitting process
   - Assign appropriate numerical prefix (next available)
   - NEVER use "phase-" in name unless a true phase
   - Create both finished and unfinished versions as appropriate

7. **Reintegration of Side-tracks**:
   - When many side-tracks accumulate, pause development
   - Create a cohesive plan integrating all side-tracks
   - Update architecture index with comprehensive view
   - Document relationships between side-tracks and phases


### Process for Updating Documentation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Documentation Need] --> B[Check Current Documentation]
    B --> C{Document Exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Copy from original/ to unfinished/]
    C -->|No| E[Create New Document in unfinished/]
    D --> F[Update Document]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Update Related Documents]
    G --> H[Update Architecture Index]
    H --> I[Run Felix]
    I --> J[Update current-work.md]
    J --> K{Implementation Complete?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Copy to finished/]
    K -->|No| M[Keep in unfinished/]
```

#### Steps for Documentation Updates:

1. **Identify Affected Systems**:
   - List all components affected by changes
   - Note which documentation files need updates
   - Determine if change affects original plan or is a side-track

2. **Update Documentation in Correct Location**:
   - Copy original documents to `unfinished/` for editing
   - For side-tracks: Create new documents in `unfinished/` with proper numerical prefix
   - Never modify files in `original/` directly
   - Ensure all status indicators are accurate

3. **Maintain Document Structure**:
   - Keep the skeleton of original document structure
   - Clearly mark additions and changes
   - Minimize duplication while preserving original structure
   - For side-tracks, document relationship to original plan

4. **Cross-Reference Updates**:
   - Update related documents with cross-references
   - Maintain consistent reference formats
   - Document relationships between side-tracks and phases

5. **Architecture Index Updates**:
   - Update component definitions if needed
   - Add new components/patterns as required
   - Ensure focus areas reflect current work
   - Document how side-tracks integrate with main architecture

6. **Complete Documentation Lifecycle**:
   - When implementation is complete, copy to `finished/`
   - Update status in current-work.md
   - Keep original documents unchanged for historical reference
   - Document lessons learned from side-tracks

## üîç Examples: Using the Integrated System

### Example 1: Finding Implementation of Architecture Component

1. Start with architecture index to find component description:
   ```
   C3:TOOL_SYSTEM - Tool registry and execution framework
   ```

2. Use code index to find implementations:
   ```
   CONTEXT C3
   ```

3. Expand code snippets to see actual implementation:
   ```
   EXPAND CS12
   ```

### Example 2: Understanding a System Feature

1. Use natural language query to find relevant components:
   ```
   mcp__context "How does the permission system work?"
   ```

2. Examine returned components and their relationships:
   ```
   S5:PERMISSION_SYSTEM|Tool permission management|
   F12>150-200:Permission classes
   F13>50-120:Permission validation logic
   ```

3. View documentation on the feature:
   ```
   EXPAND DS8
   ```

### Example 3: Updating Documentation for Multiple Systems

1. Identify all affected systems:
   ```
   FIND_REFS "permission system"
   ```

2. Update primary documentation:
   - Update `docs/tools/tool-permission-system.md`
   - Add new sections describing changes

3. Update related documents:
   - Update cross-references in `docs/00-system-architecture.md`
   - Update implementation details in specific component docs

4. Update architecture index:
   - Run `mcp__update_architecture_index`
   - Verify new components/patterns are included

5. Update current-work.md:
   - Update status for related tasks
