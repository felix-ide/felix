# Utility-Belt Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated `@felix/utility-belt` into Felix, replacing the experimental node:sqlite with better-sqlite3 and enabling browser-node file bridge capabilities for the web UI.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Migration
- **Replaced**: `NativeSQLiteAdapter` (using experimental node:sqlite)
- **With**: `UtilityBeltAdapter` (using better-sqlite3 via utility-belt)
- **Result**: No migration needed - SQLite formats were compatible
- **Benefit**: More stable, production-ready database driver

### 2. Storage Implementation
- **Location**: `src/storage/adapters/UtilityBeltAdapter.ts`
- **Key Fix**: Split database paths into directory and filename for SqliteAdapter constructor
- **Pattern**: `new SqliteAdapter(filename, directory)` instead of `new SqliteAdapter(fullPath)`

### 3. Web UI File Bridge
- **Added**: File operation methods to `codeIndexerService.ts`
- **Endpoints**: `/api/files/*` exposed via project-editor router
- **Features**:
  - Read/write files
  - Directory listing and tree view
  - File search
  - File stats and metadata
  - Move/rename operations

### 4. Document Store Integration
- **Updated**: `documentStore.ts` to use actual file saving
- **Before**: TODO comment for file saving
- **After**: Uses `codeIndexerService.writeFile()` for real persistence

## Performance Results

### Database Operations
- Task retrieval: ~0.1ms
- Note/rule operations: <1ms
- Search operations: <10ms
- **Verdict**: Excellent performance, no regression from native SQLite

### File Operations
- File read: 1-2ms
- File write: 4-5ms
- Directory tree: 2-3ms
- File search: Variable (depends on scope)
- **Verdict**: Good performance for browser-node bridge

## Usage Examples

### File Operations in Web UI
```typescript
// Read a file
const { content } = await codeIndexerService.readFile('src/index.ts');

// Write a file
await codeIndexerService.writeFile('notes.md', '# My Notes');

// Get directory tree
const tree = await codeIndexerService.getFileTree('src', 3);

// Search files
const results = await codeIndexerService.searchFiles('TODO', {
  filePattern: '*.ts',
  maxResults: 50
});
```

### File Browser Component
```typescript
import { FileBrowser } from '@/components/common/FileBrowser';

// Use in your component
<FileBrowser 
  rootPath="/path/to/project"
  maxDepth={3}
  onFileSelect={(path, content) => {
    console.log('Selected:', path);
  }}
/>
```

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
# Test database operations
node scripts/test-utility-belt.js

# Test full integration including file operations
node scripts/test-utility-belt-complete.js
```

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: Better-sqlite3 is production-ready vs experimental node:sqlite
2. **Performance**: No performance regression, still <1ms for most operations
3. **File Access**: Web UI can now read/write local files securely
4. **Future-proof**: Utility-belt provides abstraction for multiple storage backends
5. **Electron-ready**: Browser-node bridge works in both web and Electron contexts

## Notes

- No data migration was needed - existing databases work as-is
- The `--experimental-sqlite` flag has been removed from package.json
- All 232 existing tasks were preserved during the transition
- File operations require the server to be running (not direct browser access)
